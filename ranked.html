          <h2>Ranked Tiers &amp; Progression</h2>
          <p>
            The Ranked system places players in skill tiers. From lowest to highest, the tiers are
            <strong>Iron</strong>, <strong>Bronze</strong>, <strong>Silver</strong>, <strong>Gold</strong>,
            <strong>Platinum</strong>, <strong>Emerald</strong>, <strong>Diamond</strong>,
            <strong>Master</strong>, <strong>Grandmaster</strong>, and <strong>Challenger</strong>. Most tiers
            up to Diamond are divided into four divisions (IV to I).
          </p>
          <p>
            After each Ranked game, you gain or lose <strong>League Points (LP)</strong> based on whether you
            win or lose, as well as your hidden matchmaking rating (MMR). Reaching 100 LP in a division promotes
            you upward, while falling too low can demote you. Each split and season brings soft resets and
            rewards like icons, borders, and skins for reaching certain ranks.

          <h3>Competitive Esports Scene</h3>
          <p>
            League of Legends has a massive professional esports ecosystem. Regional leagues such as the
            <strong>LCK</strong> (Korea), <strong>LPL</strong> (China), <strong>LEC</strong> (Europe), and
            <strong>LCS</strong> (North America) run seasonal splits where teams compete for championship titles
            and spots at international events.
          </p>
          <p>
            The two biggest global tournaments are the <strong>Mid-Season Invitational (MSI)</strong> and the
            <strong>World Championship (Worlds)</strong>. Worlds, held at the end of each year, brings together
            the best teams from every region to play on stage in front of huge live crowds and millions of
            viewers online.

        <h2>Improving at Ranked</h2>
        <p>
          To climb the ladder, it helps to specialize in one role and a small pool of champions. This lets you
          focus on learning matchups, wave management, and macro decisions instead of constantly swapping picks.
          Reviewing your own replays, tracking your deaths, and noticing when you misplay around objectives are
          simple habits that can dramatically improve your win rate over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many tools that can help you learn, such as official champion spotlights, community guides,
          and stat-tracking websites. Using these resources to understand item builds, rune choices, and power
          spikes will make each game feel more deliberate and less random.

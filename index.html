          <h2>Objective &amp; Map Basics</h2>
          <p>
            League of Legends is played on a map called <strong>Summoner’s Rift</strong>. Two teams of five
            players start on opposite sides of the map and fight to destroy the enemy <strong>Nexus</strong>,
            the crystal structure at the center of each base. To get there, teams push through three
            <strong>lanes</strong>—top, middle, and bottom—while destroying enemy turrets and inhibitors and
            defending their own.
          </p>
          <p>
            Between the lanes lies the <strong>jungle</strong>, an area full of neutral monsters that give
            gold, experience, and powerful buffs when defeated. Controlling lanes, vision, and jungle
            objectives is what separates coordinated teams from disorganized ones.
          </p>

          <h2>Champion Basics</h2>
          <p>
            Each player controls a single <strong>champion</strong> with a distinct kit of abilities. Champions
            gain <strong>experience</strong> to level up and unlock stronger spells, and earn <strong>gold</strong>
            by killing minions, monsters, and enemy champions. That gold is spent on items that increase damage,
            durability, or utility.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the course of a match, champions scale from weak early game characters into powerful late game
            threats. Teamwork, positioning, and objective control determine whether your team converts that power
            into a win.

            <li><strong>Last-hit minions:</strong> only the final hit gives you gold.</li>
            <li><strong>Watch the minimap:</strong> check it often to avoid surprise ganks.</li>
            <li><strong>Start with simple champions:</strong> focus on learning one role at a time.</li>
            <li><strong>Play for objectives:</strong> dragons, turrets, and Baron win more games than kills.</li>

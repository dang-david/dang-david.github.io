          <h2>Role Overview</h2>
          <p>
            A standard team in League of Legends is made up of five roles: <strong>Top</strong>,
            <strong>Jungle</strong>, <strong>Mid</strong>, <strong>ADC</strong>, and <strong>Support</strong>.
            Each role plays in a different part of the map and has a specific job, from tanking damage on
            the front line to dealing consistent DPS or providing crowd control and vision. Understanding
            your role’s responsibilities is key to playing well with your team.

            <h3>Top Lane</h3>
            <p>
              Top laners usually play <strong>bruisers</strong> or <strong>tanks</strong> in a long solo lane.
              Their early game focuses on surviving, farming, and winning 1v1 or 1v2 skirmishes. Later on,
              they become a front-liner who can either start fights or apply pressure by split-pushing in a
              side lane.

            <h3>Jungle</h3>
            <p>
              Junglers clear neutral monster camps and look for opportunities to <strong>gank</strong> lanes.
              They control major objectives like <strong>Dragon</strong>, <strong>Rift Herald</strong>, and
              <strong>Baron Nashor</strong> using the Smite summoner spell. A good jungler tracks the enemy
              jungler, sets up vision, and helps their laners snowball an early lead.

            <h3>Mid Lane</h3>
            <p>
              Mid laners often play <strong>mages</strong> or <strong>assassins</strong>. Because mid is in
              the center of the map, they can push their wave and roam to help side lanes or contest river
              objectives. Mid champions typically provide high burst damage, crowd control, or important team
              utility.

            <h3>ADC (Bot Carry)</h3>
            <p>
              The ADC, or Attack Damage Carry, plays in the bottom lane and focuses on <strong>ranged damage</strong>.
              Early in the game they are vulnerable and rely on their support, but with enough items they become one
              of the highest damage threats on the team. Their main job is to stay safe while dealing continuous damage
              to enemies and objectives.

            <p>
              Supports lane with the ADC and focus on <strong>vision, utility, and peel</strong>. They buy
              support items that generate gold, place wards to control vision, and use crowd control or
              shielding to protect their carries. A strong support keeps the team safe and sets up winning
              fights.

          <h2>Role Comparison at a Glance</h2>
          <p>
            Top and Jungle usually front-line and control side-lane pressure, while Mid and ADC provide the
            majority of a team’s damage. Support ties the composition together by enabling plays, protecting
            allies, and controlling vision. When each role understands its job, the team can coordinate
            around objectives and win games much more consistently.
